# CS-340-Client-Server-Development
## Course Description
Students will learn how to apply database systems concepts and principles to develop 
client/server applications that interface client-side code with databases.
## Course Competencies
This course covers the following competencies, which represent the knowledge and skills 
relevant to your field:
- CS-30433: Apply database systems concepts and principles in the development of a 
client/server application
- CS-30434: Create a database that can interface with client-side code
- CS-30435: Develop client-side code that interfaces with databases

## Projects
How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
The most important thing for making sure that a program is adaptable is to try not to hard code anything. The CRUD python module we developed for the animal shelter can easily be used for other databases. With a couple of changes to how it is initialized, such as passing a database name, a collection name, host, and port, you can use this module for any database. At that point you would probably want to change the name of the module since it is not for an animal shelter anymore.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests? I try to approach problems by analyzing the requirements very carefully. You want to make sure you give the client exactly what they are asking for, and not add things they didn't ask for. In this project, I felt like some of the filter options where a little limited such as having labrador retriever mix but not having labrador retriever in the filter, but thats not my decision to make. That being said if I had the ability to contact the customer, I would ask about the requirement.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better? Computer scientists are responsible for designing software that is user friendly, secure, efficient, and solves the problem that the consumer has. This type of project is important because it filters through a large set of data and then displays the results in a way that is easy to read and understand.
